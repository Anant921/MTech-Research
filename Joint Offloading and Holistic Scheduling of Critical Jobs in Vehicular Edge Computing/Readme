Joint Offloading and Holistic Scheduling in Vehicular Edge Computing

This repository contains the implementation and experimental evaluation of an exact MILP-based scheduler and a polynomial-time OPA-based schedulability analysis for real-time job offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) systems.

The work models a two-stage execution pipeline—RSU upload → MEC execution—with strict non-overlapping resource constraints and firm end-to-end deadlines. It was developed as part of an M.Tech dissertation at IIT Goa.

📌 Problem Overview

In Vehicular Edge Computing, vehicles offload computation-intensive jobs to nearby Road-Side Units (RSUs) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers.
Each job must:

Upload data via an RSU (exclusive access)

Execute on a MEC server (exclusive access)

Complete both stages before its deadline

The core challenge is to determine feasible schedules that respect:

Resource conflicts

Stage dependencies

End-to-end deadlines

Execution mode choices (offloading vs local execution)

🧠 Contributions

This repository implements two complementary approaches:

1️⃣ MILP-Based Exact Scheduling

Jointly decides:

RSU selection

MEC server assignment

Local vs offloaded execution

Start/end times for all stages

Enforces non-overlap via activated Big-M constraints

Optimizes a weighted objective combining:

End-to-end delay

MEC execution cost

Produces optimal schedules when feasible

2️⃣ OPA-Based Schedulability Analysis

Assumes a fixed two-stage RSU–MEC pipeline

Derives OPA-compatible response-time bounds for:

Preemptive scheduling

Non-preemptive scheduling

Enables polynomial-time schedulability testing (O(n²))

Provides a scalable alternative to MILP

Together, these methods expose the optimality vs scalability trade-off in RSU–MEC scheduling.
